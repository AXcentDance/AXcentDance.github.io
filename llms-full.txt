Dance Etiquette | AXcent Dance Zurich AXCENT DANCE About us Schedule Registration Events Contact Log In --> More ▾ Room Rental Collaborations Corporate Events Wedding Dance Private Lessons Gallery Education Beginner Guide Blog FAQ Dance Etiquette Book Free Trial COMMUNITY GUIDELINES Dance Floor Etiquette Respect, hygiene, and kindness make the dance floor a better place for everyone. The Golden Rules 🤝 Asking for a Dance Anyone can ask! Be polite, make eye contact, and extend your hand. Accept a "No" gracefully. 🚿 Hygiene Matters Fresh breath and deodorant are musts. Bring a spare shirt if needed. Your partner will thank you! 🙏 Saying Thank You Always thank your partner at the end of the dance. It shows appreciation for the shared moment. 🛑 Respect Boundaries If a partner prefers a open hold or more distance, respect it immediately without question. 🕊️ Be Gentle Lead and follow with care. Never force a move or grip too tightly. Safety comes first. On the Dance Floor 👀 Floorcraft Watch out for others. Avoid big moves on a crowded floor and protect your partner from collisions. 🎓 No Teaching Unless asked, don't teach on the social floor. Focus on connecting and having fun, not perfection. 😊 Smile & Connect Connection beats complexity. Relax, listen to the music, and enjoy the dance. A smile goes a long way! 🚫 No Aerials Lifts and aerials are for shows, not the social floor. Keep your feet on the ground for safety. 👣 Small Steps When the floor is packed, keep your steps small and under your body to save space. Class Rules 🍬 No Chewing Gum For safety reasons, please dispose of chewing gum before class starts. 🤫 Let the Teacher Teach Please don't correct other students. If you see an issue, focus on your own dancing. ⚡ Stay Active If you are tired, take a break outside the line. Sitting in class lowers the energy of the group. 🙋 Ask Questions Properly Don't step into the middle to ask. Please raise your hand and wait for the teacher. ⏰ Be Punctual Arrive on time to warm up properly and not miss important initial instructions.
