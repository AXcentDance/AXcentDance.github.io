THE TEAM

# Who We Are

                    Passion, Technique, and Community.

## Ale y Xidan

                            We are Alessandro and Xidan, the founders of AXcent Dance. Our journey began with a shared
                            passion for Bachata Sensual and a vision to create a dance school that goes beyond just
                            teaching steps. We believe in building a community where everyone feels welcome, supported,
                            and inspired to express themselves.

                                "We are proud to be official judges for the Swiss Championship IDO."

### Our Philosophy

                            Our teaching methodology is built on a strong foundation of technique, musicality, and
                            connection. We don't just teach you what to do, but how to do it with
                            style and fluidity. We draw inspiration from various dance styles to create a unique and
                            modern approach to Bachata.

                            Beyond the classroom, we are active organizers in the dance community, hosting workshops,
                            socials, and events to bring dancers together.

Meet the instructors who make it all happen.

# Page: Beginner Guide: Your First Bachata Class | AXcent Dance Zurich (beginner-guide.html)

NEW
                    STUDENT RESOURCES

# Your First Class

                    Everything you need to know to feel confident on the dance floor.

## What to Expect

                    Walking into a dance studio for the first time can be intimidating, but at AXcent Dance, we make it
                    easy. Our community is welcoming, and everyone was a beginner once!

                        👕

### What to Wear

                        Comfort is key! Wear clothes that allow you to move freely. Gym clothes, leggings, or casual
                            wear (jeans/t-shirt) are all fine. Avoid anything too restrictive or too loose that might
                            get caught.

                        👟

### Shoes

                        Please bring a pair of clean indoor shoes. Street shoes are not allowed in
                            the studio to protect the floor. If you don't have dance shoes yet, socks or comfortable
                            sneakers are perfect for your first class.

                        🔄

### Partner Rotation

                        Bachata is a social partner dance. In our classes, we highly suggest rotating
                                partners. It helps you learn faster and meet new people. However, if you come
                            with a partner and prefer to stay together, we understand and respect that choice.

                        ✨

### Hygiene

                        Dancing is a close-contact activity. Please be mindful of your hygiene. Fresh breath (mints
                            are great!), deodorant, and a fresh shirt go a long way in making the experience pleasant
                            for everyone.

## Dance Shoe Guide

                As you progress, having the right tools makes a huge difference. Dance shoes are designed to protect
                    your knees and allow for smooth turns.

                        Do I need heels?

                            No! Especially not for beginners. Heels are optional for followers and
                            should only be worn once you have mastered your balance. Flat dance shoes or sneakers are
                            often better for learning technique.

                        Dance Sneakers

                            Brands like Fuego or Taygra offer sneakers with special
                            soles that spin easily on dance floors but look like street shoes. These are highly
                            recommended for leaders and followers alike.

                        Jazz Shoes

                            Soft, flexible, and affordable. Jazz shoes are a great entry-level option if you want to
                            feel the floor and have full foot articulation without breaking the bank.

COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

# Dance Floor Etiquette

                    Respect, hygiene, and kindness make the dance floor a better place for everyone.

## The Golden Rules

                        🤝

### Asking for a Dance

                            Anyone can ask! Be polite, make eye contact, and extend your hand. Accept a "No"
                                gracefully.

                        🚿

### Hygiene Matters

                            Fresh breath and deodorant are musts. Bring a spare shirt if needed. Your partner will
                                thank you!

                        🙏

### Saying Thank You

                            Always thank your partner at the end of the dance. It shows appreciation for the shared
                                moment.

                        🛑

### Respect Boundaries

                            If a partner prefers a open hold or more distance, respect it immediately without
                                question.

                        🕊️

### Be Gentle

                            Lead and follow with care. Never force a move or grip too tightly. Safety comes first.

## On the Dance Floor

                        👀

### Floorcraft

                            Watch out for others. Avoid big moves on a crowded floor and protect your partner from
                                collisions.

                        🎓

### No Teaching

                            Unless asked, don't teach on the social floor. Focus on connecting and having fun, not
                                perfection.

                        😊

### Smile & Connect

                            Connection beats complexity. Relax, listen to the music, and enjoy the dance. A smile
                                goes a long way!

                        🚫

### No Aerials

                            Lifts and aerials are for shows, not the social floor. Keep your feet on the ground for
                                safety.

                        👣

### Small Steps

When the floor is packed, keep your steps small and under your body to save space.

## Class Rules

                        🍬

### No Chewing Gum

For safety reasons, please dispose of chewing gum before class starts.

                        🤫

### Let the Teacher Teach

Please don't correct other students. If you see an issue, focus on your own dancing.

                        ⚡

### Stay Active

                            If you are tired, take a break outside the line. Sitting in class lowers the energy of
                                the group.

                        🙋

### Ask Questions Properly

Don't step into the middle to ask. Please raise your hand and wait for the teacher.

                        ⏰

### Be Punctual

Arrive on time to warm up properly and not miss important initial instructions.

# Dance Education

                    Understanding the history, music, and language of Bachata.

                    [Styles Explained](#styles)
                    [Musicality](#musicality)
                    [Glossary](#glossary)

## History of Bachata

                    Bachata originated in the rural neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic in the
                    early 1960s. Initially, it was known as "amargue" (bitterness) music, reflecting themes of
                    heartbreak, loss, and longing. It was often associated with the lower classes and was even banned
                    from high-society venues and radio stations for decades.

                    The music is a fusion of European influences (like the Bolero) and African rhythms inherent to the
                    Caribbean. It wasn't until the 1990s, with artists like Juan Luis Guerra (who won a
                    Grammy for his album Bachata Rosa), that Bachata gained international recognition and
                    acceptance.

                    In the early 2000s, the group Aventura (led by Romeo Santos) revolutionized the
                    genre by infusing it with R&B and Pop elements, creating "Urban Bachata" and propelling the music to
                    global superstardom.

## Bachata Styles Explained

                As Bachata spread across the globe, it evolved into distinct styles. Understanding these differences
                    helps you respect the roots while enjoying modern interpretations.

### Dominican (Traditional)

                        The Roots. This is the original style danced in the DR. It focuses heavily
                            on footwork (steps) rather than turns.

                            - Music: Faster, more raw, guitar-heavy.
                            - Movement: Box step variations, playful footwork, hip movement.
                            - Connection: Can be open or closed, very rhythmic.

### Bachata Sensual

                        The Evolution. Created in Cádiz, Spain, by Korke & Judith. It interprets the
                            music through body isolations and waves.

                            - Music: Modern remixes, pop songs, slower tempos.
                            - Movement: Body waves, head rolls, isolations, dips.
                            Connection: Mostly closed position, leading with the frame and body.

### Bachata Moderna

                        The Fusion. A bridge between the two. It incorporates the turn patterns of
                            Salsa and the basic steps of Traditional.

                            - Music: Urban Bachata (Aventura, Prince Royce).
                            - Movement: Turn patterns, cross-body leads, intricate arm work.
                            - Connection: Dynamic, mixing open and closed holds.

## Musicality Guide

                Bachata music is driven by a specific set of instruments. Learning to listen to them allows you to
                    predict the music and dance "in the pocket."

                        Requinto (Lead Guitar)
                        The melodic leader. It plays the intro, the solos, and sets the mood. Dancers often follow the
                        Requinto with their footwork.

                        Segunda (Rhythm Guitar)
                        Adds syncopation and harmony. It supports the Requinto and fills the rhythmic space.

                        Bass (Bajo)
                        The heartbeat. It usually plays on beats 1, 3, and 4 (often holding the 4). It drives the energy
                        and signals section changes.

                        Bongo
                        The rhythmic engine. The heavy hit on the 4th beat (the "Macho" drum) is what gives Bachata its
                        drive.

                        Güira
                        The metal scraper. It keeps the timing and adds the high-frequency texture that makes the music
                        danceable.

### Listening for the "Breaks"

                    A "Break" or "Corte" is a pause or accent in the music. The most common structure in Bachata is the
                    Derecho (Verse/Chorus - steady beat) and the Mambo (High energy,
                    instrumental section). Good dancers anticipate these changes to adjust their energy.

## Dance Glossary

                        Basic Step
                        Three steps to the side followed by a tap (or hip movement) on the 4th beat.

                        Tap
                        Touching the floor with the toe without transferring weight. Marks the end of a 4-count phrase.

                        Isolation
                        Moving one part of the body (e.g., chest, hips) while keeping the rest still. Key for Sensual
                        style.

                        Frame
                        The structure of the arms and upper body that allows the lead and follow to communicate
                        connection.

                        Madrid Step
                        A variation of the basic step involving a syncopated rhythm, often used in Sensual Bachata.

                        Prep
                        A preparatory movement (usually a wind-up) before a turn or spin.

                        Social
                        A party or event focused on social dancing rather than classes or performances.

                        Musicality
                        The ability to interpret the music through dance, matching movement to rhythm and melody.

Music News • December 6, 2025

# The Kings Unite: Romeo Santos & Prince Royce Drop Surprise Album

                It’s the moment Bachata fans have been dreaming of for over a decade. The "King of Bachata" Romeo Santos
                and the "Prince" Prince Royce have finally joined forces for a full collaborative album, aptly titled
                "Better Late Than Never". Released as a surprise this week, the album is already
                dominating charts and dance floors worldwide.

## A Secret 7 Years in the Making

                In a stunning reveal, the duo announced that this project has been in the works for seven years! Using
                the code names "Batman" and "Robin," they secretly recorded 13 tracks that blend their signature styles.
                The result is a masterpiece that honors traditional Bachata while pushing the genre into new, modern
                territory.

## Top Tracks to Listen To

                The album is packed with hits, but a few stand out immediately for dancers:

                    "Dardos": The lead single is a heartbreakingly beautiful
                    track about a toxic
                    relationship. The metaphor of "darts" representing emotional pain is powerful, and the rhythm is
                    perfect for sensual Bachata flow.

                    "Estocolmo": A deep dive into complex emotions, referencing
                    Stockholm Syndrome.
                    The interplay between Romeo's falsetto and Royce's smooth vocals creates a dynamic tension that is
                    amazing to interpret musically.

                    "Mi Plan": A romantic anthem that we predict will be the
                    wedding song of 2026.
                    It’s pure, classic romance at its finest.

## What This Means for Dancers

                For us in the dance community, this album is a goldmine. The production quality is top-tier, offering
                rich musicality to play with. You'll find clear beats for beginners to practice their timing, and
                complex
                instrumentals for advanced dancers to showcase their musicality.

## Conclusion

                "Better Late Than Never" lives up to the hype. It’s a celebration of Bachata’s past, present, and
                future. We are already choreographing to these tracks, so get ready to hear them in class very soon!

# Top 3 Bachata Hits Heating Up Zurich This December

                Winter has officially arrived in Zurich, but inside the studio, things are heating up! The end of 2025
                has
                brought us some incredible musical gifts, and we can't wait to share them with you. Whether you're a
                beginner finding your rhythm or an advanced dancer looking for musicality challenges, these tracks are
                essential listening.

                Music is the heartbeat of what we do. Understanding the songs, feeling the breaks, and connecting with
                the emotion is just as important as the steps. Here are the top 3 tracks dominating our playlists right
                now.

## 1. The Titans Unite

                "Inmortal" (2025 Remix)
                Romeo Santos & Prince Royce

                It finally happened. The collaborative album "Better Late Than Never" dropped this week, and the dance
                floor hasn't been the same since. While every track is a banger, "Inmortal" stands out for its classic
                Aventura vibes mixed with Prince Royce's smooth romanticism. It has a clear, steady beat that is
                perfect for practicing your basic step, but enough dramatic pauses to let you play with styling.

## 2. The Fresh Vibe

                "Ivonny Bonita"
                Karol G

                Karol G continues to prove she can conquer any genre. Her new Bachata track from the "Tropicoqueta"
                album
                brings a feminine, powerful energy that we absolutely love. The tempo is slightly faster, making it
                great
                for practicing your footwork speed and turns. Ladies, this is your anthem for Lady Styling class!

## 3. The Local Favorite

                "No Money (Bachata Edition)"
                EL CROK & Cristhian Collado

                Released just a few days ago, this track is already making waves in the European scene. It has that
                gritty, authentic Dominican flow but with a modern production polish. It's playful, fun, and impossible
                not to move to. We'll be using this one in our intermediate classes to work on musicality and
                syncopations.

## Listen & Practice

                We've added all these tracks to our "AXcent Practice" playlist on Spotify. Remember, the best way to
                improve your dancing is to listen to the music even when you aren't dancing. Let the rhythm become part
                of you.
